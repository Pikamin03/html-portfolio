<h1>The Best Movies By Aarushi</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies this August 2024</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Meri Pyaari Bindu</h3>
<p>It's a fun and quirky watch but also leaves you a little heartbroken at the end</p>
<h3>Tamasha</h3>
<p>A movie that makes you think about life and what exactly you crave for</p>
<h3>Midsommar</h3>
<p>A movie about cults and stuff, but pretty horific</p>
